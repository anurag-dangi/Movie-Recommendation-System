# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It recommends movies to users by analyzing their previous preferences and identifying similar patterns among other users. The system uses machine learning algorithms to deliver personalized suggestions, aiming to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages collaborative filtering algorithms to suggest movies based on users' viewing habits and preferences, as well as those of other similar users.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored movie suggestions for each user, increasing user satisfaction and engagement.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers visual representations of user-item interactions and the recommendation outcomes, helping to improve understanding and analysis.
- **Scalability**: Built to efficiently handle large datasets, ensuring the system remains scalable and performs well under high loads.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to implement the recommendation algorithms and system functionalities.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library, used for processing and managing movie rating data.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library employed for developing collaborative filtering algorithms.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries used for creating visualizations to display user-item interactions and recommendation results.
